AutoGrad MNIST and CNN Image Classifier

A. Autograd in Python and Numpy MNIST Classifier 
1. Implement Autograd Framework using Python and Numpy
2. Add Softmax Cross Entropy Activation Function and loss function
3. Implement Autograd Framework in Classifiying MNIST digits
4. Write Unit Test

B. CNN based image classifier using Keras and PyTorch
Custom Images( cats, dogs, bees and food images ) category
1. Accuracy for Cats and dogs = 0.6101 using 1 epoch run. Run takes 1hr and 15mins for one epoch
2. Accuracy for Food images = 0.8242 using 5 epoch run. Run takes 45mins
3. Accuracy for Bees images = 0.941176 using 24 epoch run out of 24. Used ResNET pretrained model, ConvNet as feature extractor
