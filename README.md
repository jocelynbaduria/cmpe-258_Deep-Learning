Deep Reinforcement Learning in Medical Imaging: A Literature Review

# Abstract

1.What is Deep Reinforcement Learning(DRL)?
    - It is a subset of Machine Learning called Deep Learning with an implementation
    of additional learning process called Reinforcement learning.
    
2.What is Deep Learning(DL)?
    - Deep learning is one-of-a-kind method of machine learning that uses a layered 
    neural network learning process in order to learn from data in iterative manner. 
    
3.What is Reinforcement Learning(RL)?
    - It is a learning process that uses a game theory analogy that it learns when it
    levels up during the game process through reward system.
    
4.DRL is very useful in learning medical images analysis for “object/lesion detection, 
   surgical image segmentation, registration of significant medical images”.
